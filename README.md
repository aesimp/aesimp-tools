##### Foreword
After uploading edits in poor quality for a long time, I started looking for a better solution.
My goal was to achieve the **best possible quality in upscaling, frame interpolation, and upload settings**.

---

##### Everything I use is based on _open-source projects_ (free to use):

1. [Real-CUGAN (Image-Upscale)](https://github.com/nihui/realcugan-ncnn-vulkan)
2. [FFMpeg (Video encoder)](https://ffmpeg.org/)
3. [rife-ncnn-vulkan (Frame interpolation)](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan)

All programs are combined into one tool. If you don’t already have the dependencies, they will be installed automatically.

Easy to Use

I wanted a solution that is simple and user-friendly.
With this tool, all you need to do is download the executable file and run it.
It will create a program folder as well as shortcuts in your SendTo menu.

- Install Path: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\aesimp-tools`
- SendTo Folder: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`
(You can paste these paths into File Explorer to open the folders directly.)

##### How to use

Just like creating a ZIP file:
1. **Right click** on your video
2. Go to **Send to** → **easimp converter**

A black terminal window will appear and start processing.
Once it’s finished, the window will close automatically and your converted video will be saved in the same folder as your original file.

The output file is ready to upload to social media and will play in 60 FPS!
_(On Instagram and TikTok, it may take some time until the 60 FPS version is fully processed. If you don’t see it immediately, just wait a bit.)_

##### Note

This tool connects to a background authentication API with my own Server [aesimp.com](https://aesimp.com).
It can be used offline for a limited time, but please be aware that I may decide to discontinue the service at any point.
As long as it remains available, it is free to use.

##### Problems

Windows may display a warning when running the tool, as I don’t use a code-signing certificate (which is quite expensive).
If you encounter any issues or need help, feel free to contact me via Instagram DM or Discord.
